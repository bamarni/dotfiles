# Runs a command in the PHP debug container.
#
# It assumes a configured IDE and a docker-machine using vbox.
#
# Volumes are :
#   - current working directory
#   - Composer home directory
#   - SSH helpers (known_hosts and agent forwarding), mainly needed for Composer installs from source
#   - "php-bin" is a named volume containing composer phar, mainly needed to allow selfupdate command

# skip pseudo-tty allocation when stdout is piped / redirected, otherwise stderr gets mixed with it.
